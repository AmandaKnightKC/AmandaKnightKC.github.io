## About This Portfolio

This portfolio highlights my skills as a data analyst, including:

- End-to-end data projects using **Python**, **SQL**, and **Tableau**
- Industry focus on **insurance**, **healthcare**, and **process optimization**
- Real-world projects involving **data cleaning**, **exploratory analysis**, and **dashboard development**
- Visualizations and insights designed for **business impact and storytelling**

The site was created as a professional portal to support job applications and share technical work.

## Background

This project was inspired by [Brian Mwevi’s Medium guide](https://medium.com/@brianmwevi/8-steps-to-publish-your-portfolio-on-github-9d6e6e3d2e84) on building and publishing a portfolio on GitHub.

I used the free "Developer" Bootstrap template by 3rd Wave Media as a base and customized it to fit my portfolio goals. A few widgets (e.g., GitHub calendar and Medium feed) were removed or disabled due to rendering issues.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 + CSS3
- Bootstrap 5 (no jQuery)
- Jekyll (for GitHub Pages deployment)
- SCSS
- FontAwesome
